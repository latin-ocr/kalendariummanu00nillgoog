866 Specimina judiciorum

But to do this effectually, to arouse our own hearts to interest in
behalf of the stranger from the East, we must understand his wa58‚ his
traditional peculiarities. If you reach out a pole to a man struggling with
the waves and he does not understand the act but thinks that you mean
to strike him, he will not meet your proffered help but repel it. To under-
stand the Eastern people we must become familiar with their ways by
study of their habits of devotionS‚ their doctrinal views of· essential truthS,
their privileges ad peculiarities of ecclesiastical discipline. All this is
gained from a comparison of the Greek and Latin rites as explained in
the work before uS.

There is another advantage in this study besides that of enabling
our charity to be practieal and truly Catholic. It broadens the mind.
We have suffered much in the quick growth of Catholic influence from
narrow views slavishly adhered to and without sufficient reason, which
local tradition had impressed on the individua! mind. A child will carry
the most absurd superstition far into mature life, because it is supported
by the authority of parent or teacher. Thus it happens that we measure
the practices, the convictione and motives of others differing from our
own by the narrow standard of preconoeived notions and limited know-
ledge. A married or bearded priest is taken as wanting in some essen·
tial of the sacred order by those who know only celibates and shaven
cleric-,85 and so it is in regard to other things which are condemned be·
cause misapprehended through ignorance, for which there is no excuse
among educated men.

Finally‚ a familiarity with the ritual observances of the Eastern
Catholics will enable us to foster anion, union, if not of rite, certainly
of sentiment and of zeal for the propagation of the one holy Catholie saith.
For the several Churehes oi the East proclaim one and the same saith,
and five or six nationalities unite in the fundamental spirit of their de-
votions. Thus the Ordo printed in Aleppo in the Arabian tongue is
used by the LatinS, the MelchiteS, the Armeniam, Syrians and Maronites.
In the Taqvlm Beryti translated into Arabian the feasts of t-he Chaldees
are added, so that it serves as the official Kalendas· for six nationalities,

Let Whig and Tory stir their blood;
—— There must be stormy weather —
But for some true result of good
All parties work together.

(Tennyson— Will Waterpr. Lyr. Monoloy.)

P. Nilles‚ with a diligence and rare exactness of erudition which
can only be measured by the broad scope oi his enterprise, has arranged
a sort of concordance of the various Oriental Kalendaria compared with
the Roman. This comparison is illustrated by historical and hagiographical
notes which have also in most cases a strictly critical value. Thus many
obscure terms and devotional forms of the Eastern Church and their dog-
matical sense become clear. In fact separate chapters are devoted to this
portion alone. surh as the one entitled: De terminis technis-is librorum

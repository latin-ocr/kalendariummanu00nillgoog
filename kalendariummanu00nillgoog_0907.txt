For a number of years it has been absolutely impossible to obtain
a copy of this first volume the original edition of which, published about
sixteen years ago, was quickly exhausted after the second volume had
appeared. Since that time the importunae of the work has greum far
beyond the anticipation of author or publisher, and the demand for a
complete copy of the book has brought about a new issue of the first part
which had become extremely scarce in the book mar-ket.

The value of the work — to put it. in a aut-shell -—- consiste in this
principally, that it gives us a complete and most accurate insight into
the condition and mutual relation of the Eastern and Western liturgieS.
In this respect the work is simply perfect. If we remember that the
liturgy of the Oriental churches is intimately bound up with all the doc·
trinal‚ historical and social habits and prejudices of the faithful whom the
Roman pontiff is commissioned to lead in unity of doctrine and the bond
of brotherly charity, we recognize at once the vast importance of a tho-
rough knowledge of this clement in bringing about that permanent har-
mony of action by which the schismatic bodies also will be likely to be
brought back to the bosom of the Mother church.

This importance is increased in our own case. If to Americans in
general has been assigned the noble mission of harmonizing unto mutually
hel'pful and peaceful activity the various races of God's earth -- then our
clergy have assigned them in this field a special responsibility. The vast
number of well-disposed immigrants from the East seek here an oppor-
tunity where, like many of our own kindred, they may found for them-
selveS‚ in honest thrift, a home secure from oppression, and with prospect
of improving the physical, mental and moral conditions of their posterity.
This is a Godgiven privilege. None can be more helpful to them in se-
curing it than the Catholic priest — I say the Catholic priest who by
reason of his title is justly above all national and sectional lines, The
Catholic from Hungary, Sicily, Malta, Armenia and the farther East. has
not always within reach of his needs temporal and spiritual, a pastor
whose familiar voice can call him by his own name. But he knows that
religion does not consist in wordS, that however sweet his native accent
may sound in his ear it is not essential to his receiving the gifts and
graces of God through legitimate channels of another kind than that to
which he had been accustomed. When we see a man falling within our
reach we ask no questions about his country but stretch out our hand
to lift him. When we find a child starving we do not waste time to
find out its parentage ere we offer him of our own bread. So every
priest is bound to aid these pilgrims in a strange land as best he can by
the breaking of broad, by the powerful teaching of active charity. If all
other voices, be dumb this one will speak with convincing force, for „ton-
gues may cease and knowledge shall be destroyed — charity abideth, kind,

litarqicorum ecclesiae orientali& and a previous one, De usu doymatico
testimoniorum ex libris liturgicis ecclesiae orientalis desumptorum.
Thus the earnest student is enabled to become familiar with the
Syriae, Greek, Slavic, Ronmanian, Arabic and other liturgies. The ex-
planation of the historic position of the Eastern Churcli in Hungary opens
to his mind the understanding of the tangled relations of Catholics of
Greek and Armenian rite who come to this country from the south and

east of Europe and the Asian borderland. We learn something of the
ways in which the slavic language came to be used in churches of the

Latin rite and how the two are often mxied in the same service. The
illustrious Archbishop of Vhrbosnia, who fully grasps the significance of
this work at the present moment, speaks of it in terms that can hardly
be exaggerated. After referring to the desire of Leo XIII. to unite the
East and West into the one household of the apostolic saith, he points
out how neccessary it is in order to bring about such a union, that the
different national elements should know and understand each other —-
„ut alter alterius ritum et res omnes, quae eo spectant, dies festos,
jejunia, caeremonias omneque pietatis (lerum, dih'qenter addiscat, bene-
vole interpretetur, ex aequo aestimet, meril‘oque honore prosequatur.
Deinde vero necessarium esse judicamus * * variae discrepantes opiniones
dilucide explicentur ex textibus liturgicis et ex libris Sanctorum ipsius
orientalis ecclesiae: qui ut caeteris solent esse accessu faciliores, sic et
christianis orientalibus apertiores sunt ad intelligendum atque inde ad vul-
garem popularemque sensum prae aliis accomodati.“

„Now such a work,“ says the illustrious Apostolic Commissary to
whom the labor of devising means by which to promote the above men-
tioued union had been especially entrusted by the Holy Father, „such a
work has been prepared for the use of our young clergy by R. P. Nilles,
professor at Innsbruck. These two volumes have been considered so ex-
cellently adapted to the said purpose that they have received, as is well
known, the unanimous and most flattering commendation of the learned
men who are judges representing many bishops of different nationalitieS.“

In fact it was through Archbishop Stadler's exertions mainly that this
first volume has been reprinted, for the expense of getting up a work in

which so many different languages are represented, by their particular
character of type, is necessarily great. The· Archbishop thus concludes
his encyclical letter to the clergy under his commissariate: „It is not for
us to increase the merited fame which this work everywhere enjoys among
the learned of every elasa, but we would earnestly recommend the assi-
duous study of it to the clergy who live in contact with Christiana of
various riteS, so that they might attain a correct knowledge of the prac-
tices of the Eastern ChristianS, and make use of this knowledye as op-
portunity affords‚ for the purpose of fostering sacred union.“

The first volume is limited to a discusion of the immoeable feasts
whilst the second volume, of which a new edition is likewise in preSS,
treats of the movable feastS. There is another part (embracing two vo-
lumes oi altogether over a thousand pages) which is a sort of supplement
to the Kalendarium and treats historically and in· detail what might be
